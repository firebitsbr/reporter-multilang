# Reporter Multilang

A tool to generate human-readable reports based on data from various sources
<br />with the focus on its implementation using a series of programming languages

**TODO:** Gentlemen, start your axes! &ndash; I.e. wait a little while there would not be at least three complete implementations. For the moment there are the following ones:
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Perl 5 (5.10+) implementation (complete)
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Python 3 implementation (in progress)
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Vala, Go, and Java implementations (planned)

---

**TODO:** Provide brief description of the project and other related sections (overview, design, building, running, etc.).
